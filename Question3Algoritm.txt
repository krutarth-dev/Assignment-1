1)Initialize two pointers, left and right, to the start and end indices of the array, respectively.
2)While left is less than or equal to right, perform the following steps:
        ->Calculate the middle index as mid = (left + right) // 2.
        ->If the value at the middle index is equal to the target, return the middle index.
        ->If the value at the middle index is greater than the target, update right = mid - 1 to search in the left half of the array.
        ->If the value at the middle index is less than the target, update left = mid + 1 to search in the right half of the array.
 3)If the target is not found during the binary search, the left pointer will point to the index where the target should be inserted. 
 Return left.
